8683634,T1,MajorClaim,"Combined radiation therapy and chemotherapy after surgery, compared with postsurgical radiation therapy alone, has been shown to improve disease-free survival and overall survival significantly among patients with poor-prognosis (i.e., advanced stage disease or metastasis to regional lymph nodes) resectable rectal cancer.",
8683634,T2,Claim,"However, the combined therapy is associated with more toxic effects, raising the question of whether the benefits of the treatment justify its quality-of-life costs for the individual patient.",
8683634,T3,Premise,"As reported previously, the combined therapy reduced the risk of relapse by 34% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 12%-50%; P = .0016) and reduced the overall death rate by 29% (95% CI = 7%-45%; P = .025) in comparison with adjuvant radiation therapy alone.",
8683634,T4,Premise,"In the 5 years following assignment to treatment, patients who received the combined therapy had more time with toxicity (3.1 months; 95% CI = 2.0-4.1 months), shorter survival after relapse (3.6 months less; 95% CI = 0.9-6.3 months less), and more TWiST (6.1 months; 95% CI = 0.2-12.0 months) than patients who received adjuvant radiation therapy alone.",
8683634,T5,Claim,"Despite an increase in the amount of time that individuals spent with early and late toxic effects, the Q-TWiST analysis indicated that the combined therapy conferred significantly greater benefit for a wide range of patient preferences about living with the toxicity of treatment or the symptoms of overt disease.",
8683634,T6,Claim,"Use of combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy as an adjuvant to surgery for patients with poor-prognosis resectable rectal cancer is justified,",
8683634,T7,Premise,"since the improved outcome in terms of delayed recurrence and increased survival balances the time spent with early and late toxic effects.",
8683634,T8,Claim,"The Q-TWiST method is an excellent way to compare treatment outcomes that include quality-of-life considerations.",
8839553,T1,Claim,"Cerebral metastasis is a common oncologic problem that occurs in 15-30% of cancer patients;",

8839553,T4,Premise,"the median survival for the radiation group was 6.3 months (95% confidence interval, 3-11.4) compared with 5.6 months for the surgery plus radiation group (95% confidence interval, 3.9-7.2) (P = 0.24).",
8839553,T5,Premise,"Most patients died within the first year (69.8% in the radiation arm vs. 87.8% in the surgery plus radiation arm).",
8839553,T6,Premise,"There were no significant differences in the 30-day mortality, morbidity, or causes of death.",
8839553,T7,Premise,"Extracranial metastases was an important predictor of mortality (relative risk, 2.3).",
8839553,T8,Premise,"The mean proportion of days that the Karnofsky performance status was > or = 70% did not differ between the 2 groups.",
8839553,T9,Claim,"This trial failed to demonstrate that the addition of surgery to radiation therapy improved outcome of patients with a single brain metastasis.",
8839553,T10,Claim,"Thus, the efficacy of surgery plus radiation compared with radiation alone needs to be addressed by further clinical trials and/or a meta-analysis.",
9626213,T1,Premise,"Hematologic toxicity was significantly more severe in arm A (leukopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia grade 3 or 4: 66% v 19%, 83% v 55%, 36% v 2% in arms A and B, respectively), which resulted in more febrile neutropenia (27% v 3% in arms A and B, respectively), dose reductions, and treatment delays.",
9626213,T2,Premise,"There were a total of nine toxic deaths, six due to neutropenic sepsis: five in arm A and one in arm B.",
9626213,T3,Premise,"In contrast, arthralgia/myalgia (grade 2 or 3, 4% v 17%), peripheral neurotoxicity (grade 2 or 3, 6% v 29%), and hypersensitivity reactions (1% v 7%, all grades) were significantly more frequent in arm B.",
9626213,T4,Claim,"The frequency and severity of other toxicities were comparable between the two arms.",
9626213,T5,Premise,"Responses were one complete and 44 partial on arm A (28%) and two complete and 61 partial (41%) on arm B (P = .018).",
9626213,T6,Premise,"There was no significant difference in survival, with median and 1-year survivals 9.9 versus 9.7 months and 41% versus 43%, respectively in arm A and B.",
9626213,T7,Premise,"Progression-free survival was 4.9 and 5.4 months in arm A and B, respectively.",
9626213,T8,Premise,"Arm B achieved a better score at week 6 for emotional, cognitive and social functioning, global health status, fatigue, and appetite loss, which was lost at 12 weeks.",
9626213,T9,Claim,"In conclusion, arm B appears superior to arm A with regard to response rate, side effects, and QoL.",

9640214,T4,Premise,"Ratings of cosmetic results decreased with time, in line with clinical observations of long-term side-effects of radiotherapy.",
9640214,T5,Claim,"Wide excision appeared to be the most important predictive factor for poor cosmetic result.",
9640214,T6,Claim,"In this multicentre randomised study, BCT helped to maintain the patients' body image, resulted in higher satisfaction with treatment and yielded no significant difference from MRM with respect to fear of recurrence.",
9643663,T1,Premise,"At a median follow-up period of approximately 100 weeks for both studies, 'Casodex' 150 mg was found to be less effective than castration in patients with metastatic disease (M1) at entry (hazard ratio of 1.30 for time to death) with a difference in median survival of 6 weeks.",
9643663,T2,Premise,"In symptomatic M1 patients, 'Casodex' was associated with a statistically significant improvement in subjective response (70%) compared with castration (58%).",
9643663,T3,Premise,"Analysis of a validated quality-of-life questionnaire proved an advantage for 'Casodex' in sexual interest and physical capacity.",
9643663,T4,Premise,"'Casodex' had a substantially lower incidence of hot flushes compared to castration (6-13% compared with 39-44%) and the most commonly reported adverse events were those expected for a potent antiandrogen.",
9643663,T6,Claim,"in patients with M0 disease at entry, the data are still immature with only 13% of M0 patients having died.",
9643663,T7,Claim,"An initial analysis of this immature data has suggested that the results in these patients may be different to those obtained in patients with M1 disease.",

9643663,T9,Claim,"'Casodex' has shown a benefit in terms of quality of life and subjective response when compared to castration and has an acceptable tolerability profile.",
